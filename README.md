**Coding at Creating Change - Beginner Level**

## Instructions

Create a new folder for your project.

We need a program to edit text. Download [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/) and open it. There are many text editors available; this is just one that we like.

Create a new folder inside your folder and name it css.

[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) is a framework that makes it easier to style your basic webpage. Go to the [Bootstrap website](http://getbootstrap.com/), click download, and then click download Bootstrap. Save it in your downloads folder.

Open the newly downloaded zip file. Open the dist folder, then the css folder. Then copy the bootstrap.css file into your css folder.

Open your project folder in Sublime by right clicking it and selecting open with. In Sublime, you should see your project folder and your css folder.

Using Sublime, create a new file in your project folder by right clicking on the project folder and selecting new file. Name it index.html

Do that again in Sublime to create a new file in your css folder called styles.css
